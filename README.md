# React Todo List Application

A simple yet effective Todo List application built with React, utilizing the Context API for state management. This application allows users to add, update, delete, and toggle the completion status of todos. It also features persistent storage using Local Storage, ensuring todos are not lost upon page refresh.

## Features

- **Add New Todos:** Quickly jot down what needs to be done.
- **Update Existing Todos:** Modify todos as plans change.
- **Delete Todos:** Remove todos that are no longer needed.
- **Toggle Completion Status:** Mark todos as completed or pending.
